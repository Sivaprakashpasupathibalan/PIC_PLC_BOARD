This Library is Written for using NSK PIC_PLC Board WITH 5 OUTPUTS and 8 INPUTS and 4 ADC Channels and RS485/UART

It has the functions which will perform same as arduino on PIC16F886

Library Modules Consists of PLC_IO.C which has the functions to Initialize the PORTS for Output and Inputs with Settings.

CONFIG.H contains the fuses for PIC16F886

PLC_IO.C Contains functions INIT_IO() it initializes the PORT functions, PIN_STATUS(IN8) returns the value 1 or 0 depending upon the pin status,
RELAY_SET(RLY1,HIGH) It sets the RELAY HIGH AND LOW when function is called with parameters.
